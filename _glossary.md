# Glossary

##### Ceramic

[Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and
sharing streams of data.

##### Credential Claim

A claim is a statement about a subject, e.g. about their identity, location, accomplishments, owned property, etc.

##### DAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a self-organizing online
community that uses blockchains like Ethereum to manage its funds securely and make collective decisions on the future of the organization

##### DID(Decentralized Identifier)

A DID(Decentralized Identifier) is a portable, globally unique, URL-based identifier, associated with an entity. DIDs enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures. An example of aDID is `did::example:123456abcdef`.

##### Ethereum

[Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.

##### Self.Id

[Self.Id](https://self.id/) is a multi-platform identity protocol for web3 decentralized user profiles on top of the Ceramic Network.

##### Credential Issuer

A role an entity performs by asserting and verifying claims about one or more
subjects, creating a verifiable credential from these claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a subject or holder. Example issuers include corporations, non-profit organizations, trade associations, governments, and individuals.

##### Credential Subject

An entity about which claims are made. Example subjects include human beings,
animals, and things. In many cases the holder of a verifiable credential is the subject, but in certain cases it is not.

##### ThreadDB

[ThreadDB](https://textile.io/) is a secure, decentralized, p2p database built on IPFS and Libp2p.

##### KRB Token

See [KRB Token](krb)

##### ERC-20 Token

A Token is a unit that represents value which can be bought, sold, or traded. ERC-20 is an Etherum standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token.

##### Verifiable Credential

A [W3C Verifiable Credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) Is an attestation made by an Issuer to verify the validity of a claim. Credentials include an identifier and metadata to describe properties of the credential, such as the issuer, the expiry date, a public key to use for verification purposes, the revocation mechanism, etc. The metadata is signed cryptographically to prove who issued it.

##### Credentials Registry

A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials.

##### Web3

Web3 is the new iteration of the web, where applications donâ€™t run on central or private cloud servers, instead they either run on blockchains, ecentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes, or a combination of the two that forms a trustless, verifiable, self-governing, stateful crypto-economic protocol. These apps are often referred to as dapps (decentralized apps).
