## Manifesto

In a world where likes and followers are fake or paid, making deals and trusting people that you don't know on the internet is hard. You don't know if the buy/sell publication or even the reviews are from real persons or fake/duplicated accounts. And if you are an honest user, and take the time and effort to build a proper reputation on a platform, you can't take it to another platform and have to start over from scratch.

So, how can we buy/sell products and services with confidence in the other parties? How can we build an online reputation that we can take with us to any other platform?

Decentralized Reputation (DeRep) has great challenges: sovereign-identities, reputation calculation, sybil attacks, governance, vote buying, vote swings, vote apathy, plutocracy, etc.

Krebit mitigates all of them and creates a **pseudonymous economy** for users to prove things about them without revealing any unnecessary information:

1. **Krebit is an open identity verification protocol, DAO and marketplace for Web3 Verifiable Credentials.**

2. Our vision is allowing the people to trust each other again and **maximize social capital**, by serving as a reputation scoring platform for all members of the blockchain community.

3. Krebit is governed by an open DAO of stakeholders, industry experts and project partners.

4. Krebit provides a **Decentralized Reputation (DeRep) DApp** for building the Web3 of Trust. Krebit will provide a Claim Verification Marketplace where people will be able to import their external reputation scores from web2 verified oracles and web3.

5. Krebit's **Web3 of Trust** relies on all of it's members to ensure they only verify claims that they have confirmed are true. i.e. If your attestation signature is registered on-chain, you will earn KRB. If your attestation is disputed and voted by the DAO, your staked KRB could be burnt.

6. Any member can also **dispute a Verifiable Credential via proposal** on the Krebit DAO. Once raised, disputes must be resolved by voting and the $KRB rewards could get burnt and the verifierâ€™s stake could get slashed.

7. Krebit will use **scalable, decentralized, privacy preserving identity systems** running on top of off-chain, open, data-models and the main public blockchains.

8. Users will be able to manage their identities and other dApps will be able to obtain real-time reputation of an identity owner across different blockchains. By using this **open data-model**, other dApps will also be able to create claims, verify them and register them, all from common known identities.

9. **Krebit smart contracts will be deployed on EVM compatible blockchains**, and there will be bridges to other blockchains, and verified oracles for web2 sites, to ensure future aggregation of Decentralized Reputation (DeRep) across a multi-chain ecosystem.

10. Krebit is not going to reinvent the wheel. Instead, we intend to use the best existing tools and best practices for each component of the architecture.
