# Get Verified

## Quick Start

With Krebit you can verify your identity only once, and reuse it everywhere across the Web3:

**Step 1:** Login to your DID connecting your Wallet.

**Step 2** Store your Claim Credentials encrypted, off-chain.

**Step 3:** Request verification from a Krebit DAO verified Issuer.

**Step 4:** Get the VerifiableCredential from the Issuer and register it on-chain to earn KRB tokens!

## Login with Wallet

!> **Where is my Krebit Wallet stored?** We use the Local Storage in your browser to store and encrypt the Krebit Wallet information locally with a twelve-word seed phrase and a password you provide, that we never send to our servers. Please read the full Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for more details. Local Storage, including Javascript-enabled localStorage, is a typical way for a website to store a small file of letters and numbers in your browser. Local Storage are deleted when the website that stored them deletes them. You can also delete Local Storage from your browser at any time you like by visiting your web browser settings.

## Claim Credentials

For example, a user can claim a social network profile by posting the KRB address on the public bio (proof that the user has control over the identity) and ask for another memberâ€™s confirmation or ask to have a claim disputed via DAO vote approval.

## Request Verification

Identity proofs are social and based on trust; It means you must get attestation from some of the previously accepted users, i.e. verifiers. These verifiers ask you to reproduce your claim via a P2P encrypted chat on Krebit dApp. After collecting enough trust in the form of KRB, the user is recognized as a valid and unique one.
