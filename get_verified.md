# Get Verified

## Quick Start

With Krebit you can verify your identity only once, and reuse it everywhere across the Web3:

**Step 1:** Login to your DID connecting your Wallet.

**Step 2** Store your Claim Credentials encrypted, off-chain.

**Step 3:** Request verification from a Krebit DAO verified Issuer.

**Step 4:** Get the VerifiableCredential from the Issuer and register it on-chain to earn KRB tokens!

## Login with Wallet

Krebit is a **user-centic protocol**. It uses Ceramic's Self.Id Decentralized Identity (DID) to enable users control their profiles and data-stores.

A user can login with a **Non-Custodial ethereum wallet** and take ownership of their data.

We currently support the Metamask extension, and a Krebit Wallet cached in the browser:

?> **Where is my Krebit Wallet stored?** We use the Local Storage in your browser to store and encrypt the Krebit Wallet information locally with a twelve-word seed phrase and a password you provide, that we **never** send to our servers. Please read the full [Terms of Service](https://krebit.id/#/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://krebit.id/#/privacy) for more details.

2. Login With Wallet

3. Deleting Wallet

Local Storage, including Javascript-enabled localStorage, is a typical way for a website to store a small file of letters and numbers in your browser. Local Storage items are deleted when the website that stored them deletes them. You can also delete Local Storage from your browser at any time you like by visiting your web browser settings.

#### **Metamask**

1. Download and install the Metamask extension for your browser: [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/)

!> **Your Keys, your Wallet:** Please make sure to save a copy of the Wallet's 12 seed words, it is the **only** way to recover your wallet and access to your DID in case of browser cache clearing, app data lost, or forgetting the PIN.

## Claim Credentials

For example, a user can claim a social network profile by posting the KRB address on the public bio (proof that the user has control over the identity) and ask for another memberâ€™s confirmation:

[filename](/guides/Create-Krebit-Identity-Claims.mp4" ":include :type=video controls width=250")

## Request Verification

Request verification from a Krebit DAO verified Issuer:

[filename](/guides/Request-Krebit-Verification.mp4" ":include :type=video controls width=250")

Identity proofs are social and based on trust; It means you must get attestation from some of the previously accepted users, i.e. verifiers. These verifiers ask you to reproduce your claim via a P2P encrypted chat on Krebit dApp.

## Register Verifiable Credential

Get the VerifiableCredential from the Issuer and register it on-chain to earn KRB tokens:

[filename](/guides/Register-Krebit-Verifiable-Credentials.mp4" ":include :type=video controls width=250")

After collecting enough trust in the form of KRB, the user is recognized as a valid and unique one.
