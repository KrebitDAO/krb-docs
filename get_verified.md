# Get Verified

## Quick Start

With Krebit you can verify your identity only once, and reuse it everywhere across the Web3:

**Step 1:** Login to your DID connecting your Wallet.

**Step 2:** Get the VerifiableCredential from the Issuer and register it on-chain to earn KRB tokens!

## Login with Wallet

Krebit is a **user-centic protocol**. It uses Ceramic's Decentralized Identity (DID) to enable users control their profiles and data-stores.

A user can login with a **Non-Custodial ethereum wallet** and take ownership of their data.

We currently support the Metamask extension and Wallet Connect.

Identity proofs are social and based on trust; It means you must get attestation from some of the previously accepted users, i.e. verifiers.

After collecting enough trust in the form of KRB, the user is recognized as a valid and unique one.
