# How to Issue credentials

## Requirements

There is a Minimum KRB balance to become a verifier/issuer. Only members with verified identities (as per a minimum balance of KRB to issue) can validate attestations. When a verifier provides judgement, they gain trust by performing proper due diligence and would presumably be replaced for issuing faulty judgments.

## Creating Credentials (no-code)

1. Choose the credential type:

![Create-Credentials](/guides/krebit-create-credentials.png ":size=800")

2. Enter the credential details:

![Create-Credential-Details](/guides/krebit-create-poa.png":size=800")

3. After the credential type is created, you can send the link for your users to caim it.

Verifiable Credentials can be revoked by an Issuer, they can expire, and also be deleted by the credential subject. In all these cases both the issuer and subject rewards are also burnt.
